I enjoy solving problems on Codeforces using the C++ programming language. Codeforces provides 
a challenging and competitive platform where I can enhance my problem-solving skills and algorithmic
thinking. Whether it's tackling intricate algorithms or implementing data structures, C++ is my language
of choice for its efficiency and versatility. I find great satisfaction in participating in Codeforces 
contests and improving my coding abilities through the diverse range of problems it offers.
